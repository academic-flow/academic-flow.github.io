## Community Feedback 

* Dennyse B. 

This site is great and I love the idea behind it. I don't get the chance to talk to my professors very often so this gives me the opportunity to get to know them in a different way.

 * David B.

This website has made trading card games more fun for me, a student. It is not only about the game but also creating relationships with other students and professors in my university. This makes a different experience from typical academic activities.

 * Samuel P.

I praise the group who made this website for their fresh idea! They used the liking of trading card games to build a space where students and faculty can connect with one another socially. This is beneficial for all parties involved.

 * Daniel D.

The website is not only a place for trading card games, it functions more like a hub for students to interact and I love the idea.

 * Darius E. 

I love the idea and it's so creative. I think it's great because of how popular the Pokemon trading card game was over the pandemic. It's a great idea for students to interact and know their professors better. 

Overall, the website has been well received. People like its fresh idea of using trading card games as a way for students and professors to connect socially. They value getting to engage with faculty in a different setting, noticing how it adds depth to their university life beyond regular study activities.
